     Caitail started out linked many of the newer charactes to the destiny universe, as and enemy who wanted to kill the comander. However as you progress thorugh the 
     story you come to realise she i sonly doing this so that the major villain at this stage was able to be killed.
     She is the empress of the cabal, an alien species. she is a great allie, due to the fact that she has light suppressing weapons
     and the enimies we are facing know have our powers the lightl.
